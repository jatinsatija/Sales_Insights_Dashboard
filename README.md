# Sales_Insights_Dashboard
Here is a data analysis project I completed using Tableau and SQL for a hardware company in India as part of my data science journey.

# About the Project
Completed a Data Analysis project for a hardware manufacturer in India.

A star schema data model was designed on Tableau and data cleaning was carried out once the data was moved to the staging area via ETL mappings created using SQL.

Created an analytical Tableau dashboard, generating quantitative visuals in Tableau to derive important insights from various factors impacting the company's performance annually and offer further business solutions.

# Problem Statement
Sales Director wants to know the company's performance in various Indian States and take business actions accordingly.

Q1. Annual Revenue Patterns

Q2. Revenue patterns by Market 

Q3. Top 5 customers by revenue 

Q4. Sales patterns by Market

Q5. Net Profit & Profit Margin by Market

Q6. Most Profitable Customers

**What is the purpose? Why? What are we hoping to accomplish?**

To reduce the amount of time spent manually gathering data by unlocking sales insights that were previously invisible to the sales team and automating them for decision assistance.

**Stakeholders involved:**

- Sales Director
- I.T. Team
